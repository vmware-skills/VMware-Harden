  Use this skill whenever the user needs to perform VMware cyber compliance auditing (aligned with VCF 9 Advanced Cyber Compliance / ACC),
  baseline checking, or drift detection on vSphere/ESXi/NSX environments.
  Directly handles: CIS / vSphere SCG / 等保 2.0 三级 / PCI-DSS / BSI IT-Grundschutz / EU NIS2 scans;
  custom YAML baselines; LLM-driven remediation suggestions; web dashboard.
  Always use this skill for "scan compliance", "check baseline", "audit etcd",
  "check 等保", "drift detection", "compliance report", "cyber compliance scan", "ACC posture", "STIG check" when the context is
  explicitly VMware/vSphere/ESXi.
  Do NOT use for general vSphere monitoring (use vmware-monitor or vmware-aiops),
  network changes (use vmware-nsx), or executing remediations directly
  (this skill only suggests; execution goes through vmware-pilot).

## What This Skill Does

| Category | Tools | Count | Read or Write |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Baseline Management | 9 built-in baselines (CIS ESXi 8.0/9.0, vSphere SCG v8/v9, vSphere 9 STIG, 等保 2.0 L3, PCI-DSS 4.0, BSI ITGS, EU NIS2) + custom YAML loader | 9+N | Read |
| Scanning | Multi-collector (vCenter, ESXi, NSX, vSAN, K8s) → typed Twin store | 1 pipeline | Read (no target writes) |
| Drift Detection | Snapshot-to-snapshot configuration diff (per-node added/removed/changed fields) | 1 type | Read |
| Remediation Advisor | LLM-driven (Anthropic) suggestions per violation; mock fallback when no key | 1 advisor | Read |
| Web Dashboard | FastAPI + Jinja2 read-only UI for violations / drift / advice | 1 server | Read |
| MCP Server | Compliance query tools | 8 | All Read |

## Quick Install

```bash
uv tool install vmware-harden
vmware-harden baseline list
```

For first-time use, ensure a vmware-aiops target is configured (harden uses aiops collectors) and optionally set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for live remediation advice.

## When to Use This Skill

Use vmware-harden when the user needs to:

- Run a **compliance scan** against CIS / vSphere SCG / **vSphere 9 STIG-aligned** / 等保 2.0 三级 / PCI-DSS / BSI IT-Grundschutz / EU NIS2
- **Author or import a custom YAML baseline** (e.g., internal corporate baseline)
- Detect **drift** between two scans of the same target
- Get **AI-suggested remediation steps** for a violation (advice only — does not execute)
- Browse a **web dashboard** of compliance posture across multiple targets

**Do NOT use this skill when**:

- The task is general vCenter/ESXi monitoring or read-only inspection → use **vmware-monitor**
- The task is VM lifecycle, snapshots, or guest operations → use **vmware-aiops**
- The user wants to actually **execute** a remediation (set advanced setting, change DFW rule, etc.) → use **vmware-pilot** (multi-step approval-gated workflow)
- The task is purely NSX networking/segments → use **vmware-nsx**
- The user wants **continuous, fleet-wide compliance enforcement + automated remediation** across the estate → use **VCF Operations SPM/ACC (UI)**. VCF Operations 9.1 Automated Configuration Compliance / Security Posture Management is UI- and schedule-driven (paid Salt engine) and exposes **no public compliance API**. harden is the complementary, **API-scriptable, DuckDB-persisted, cross-target point-in-time scanner** for CI and agent workflows; it does not replace SPM/ACC. See [references/stig-content-sync.md](./references/stig-content-sync.md).

## Common Workflows

### 1. First-time scan with 等保 2.0 三级

1. Install: `uv tool install vmware-harden`
2. Verify aiops is configured: `vmware-aiops doctor` — harden reuses aiops connection for the vCenter collector
3. List baselines: `vmware-harden baseline list` — confirm `dengbao-2.0-level3-vmware` is present
4. Scan: `vmware-harden scan --baseline dengbao-2.0-level3-vmware --target prod-vcenter`
5. Report: `vmware-harden report --format json > violations.json` (or `vmware-harden web` for the rendered dashboard). The JSON is an object — `{"violations": [...], "coverage": {...}}` — read `coverage` before reporting a result; an empty `violations` list only means nothing was found among the checks that could be made.

   **Failure branch**: If you see `ConnectError: vmware-aiops target not found`, the aiops side is not configured. Run `vmware-aiops init` first; harden cannot scan without a working collector.

### 2. Custom baseline import + scan

1. Author YAML under `~/.vmware-harden/baselines/my-corp.yaml` (see references for schema)
2. Validate: `vmware-harden baseline validate ~/.vmware-harden/baselines/my-corp.yaml`
3. Import: `vmware-harden baseline import ~/.vmware-harden/baselines/my-corp.yaml`
4. Scan: `vmware-harden scan --baseline my-corp --target prod-vcenter`

   **Failure branch**: `baseline validate` failure usually means a `check.path` references a node type the collectors do not produce (e.g. `nsx.gateway.*` when no NSX collector ran). See [references/cli-reference.md](./references/cli-reference.md) for valid node paths and the baseline schema.

### 3. Drift investigation

1. Run scan today: `vmware-harden scan --target prod-vcenter --baseline cis-vmware-esxi-8.0-subset`
2. Run scan again next week (or after a change window): same command
3. View drift: `vmware-harden drift` (renders the latest snapshot vs its prior snapshot for the same target)
4. Get advice on critical drift: `vmware-harden advise --violation-id <id>` or `vmware-harden advise --all-critical` (uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; falls back to mock template if unset)
5. Open web view: `vmware-harden web --port 8080` then navigate to `/drift`

   **Failure branch**: If `vmware-harden drift` reports `No drift detected since previous snapshot`, both scans likely ran against the same state. Ensure two scans actually completed against the same `--target`; the Twin DB at `~/.vmware-harden/twin.duckdb` must contain at least two snapshots for that target.

## Usage Mode

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|:-----------:|-----|
| Local CLI scans by an operator | **CLI** | Direct, scripts well into CI |
| AI agent integration | **MCP** | 8 read-only tools, structured responses |
| Reviewing posture interactively | **Web** | `vmware-harden web` — sortable tables, drift timeline |
| CI/CD pipeline gates | **CLI** | Exit code reflects compliance pass/fail |

## MCP Tools (8 — 8 read, 0 write)

| Category | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Baseline | `list_baselines` | All built-in + imported baselines (id, framework, version) |
| Baseline | `get_baseline_rules` | Rules for a given baseline_id (severity, references) |
| STIG | `list_stig_controls` | vSphere 9 STIG-aligned controls (id, severity, ESXi advanced setting) |
| STIG | `describe_stig_content_sync` | How harden syncs STIG content + routing to SPM/ACC (no compliance API) |
| Violation | `list_violations` | Current violations, filterable by severity |
| Violation | `get_remediation` | Remediation suggestion for a violation_id (LLM or mock) |
| Drift | `list_drift_events` | Recent drift events from snapshot diff |
| Scan | `scan_target` | Trigger a scan against a target (read-only on the target) |

All 8 tools are **read-only** with respect to vSphere/NSX. Writes to the local Twin DuckDB are scan-internal and do not modify any VMware resource. Actual remediation execution is intentionally **deferred to vmware-pilot** (approval-gated).

**List results are enveloped.** `list_baselines`, `get_baseline_rules`, and `list_drift_events` return `{items, returned, limit, total, truncated, hint}` rather than a bare list, so completeness is stated rather than inferred — read the rows from `items`, and treat `truncated: true` as "there is more, raise `limit`". Because the twin is a local DuckDB, `total` is a real count, not an estimate: a page that exactly fills `limit` is still reported `truncated: false` when it is genuinely the whole set. `list_violations` keeps its own older `{violations, total, limit, offset, has_more}` envelope with the same guarantee.

**An empty violation list is not a compliance verdict.** A rule can only judge configuration that was actually gathered, and that fails two independent ways — both reported, neither as passing:

- **No collector produces the attribute**, so the rule was never run → `coverage.undetermined` with `undetermined_rules` naming the attribute. Collector work.
- **The rule ran but found no value on a given node** (host unreachable, account lacks the privilege, setting absent on that build) → `coverage.node_checks_undetermined` with `undetermined_node_checks` naming the rule, node and missing attribute. Access work. A rule that found no node of its type at all is listed in `coverage.rules_without_targets`.

`list_violations` and `scan_target` return the full `coverage` block (`{evaluated, undetermined, total, tracked, complete, undetermined_rules, node_checks_evaluated, node_checks_undetermined, node_checks_total, nodes_affected, node_tracked, undetermined_node_checks, rules_without_targets}`) plus a `note` summarising it. Read it before summarising: when `complete` is false, say what was not checked and never call the estate compliant or clean. `tracked: false` means the snapshot predates coverage tracking; `node_tracked: false` means it predates per-node tracking (pre-v1.10.0) — re-scan rather than assume either.

## Troubleshooting

### "vmware-aiops target not found" / collectors return empty
Harden does not connect to vCenter directly — it relies on vmware-aiops collectors. Run `vmware-aiops doctor` and confirm the `--target` name matches an aiops target.

### `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set — advice looks generic
The advisor falls back to a deterministic mock template when no API key is present. Set `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` in your shell or in `~/.vmware-harden/.env` for live LLM-driven suggestions.

### `uvx` reports "UnknownIssuer" behind a corporate TLS proxy
Don't use `uvx` for the MCP server in this environment. Use the entry point installed by `uv tool install`:

```json
{
  "command": "vmware-harden",
  "args": ["mcp"]
}
```

This avoids `uvx` re-resolving PyPI through the corporate MitM proxy. The legacy `vmware-harden-mcp` console script still works and is equivalent. As a workaround, `UV_NATIVE_TLS=true` lets uv use the system CA store. See CLAUDE.md 踩坑 #25.

### "Twin DB not found" on first MCP call
Run at least one scan first: `vmware-harden scan --baseline cis-vmware-esxi-8.0-subset --target <t>`. The DuckDB file is created on first scan at `~/.vmware-harden/twin.duckdb` (override with `VMWARE_HARDEN_DB`).

### 等保 baseline reports most rules as not evaluated
Three different causes, and the report distinguishes them. A rule whose attribute no collector produces is recorded `undetermined` with the reason naming that attribute — see `coverage.undetermined_rules`; those are collector work, tracked in RELEASE_NOTES. Separately, the 等保 baseline spans several collectors (vCenter advanced settings + NSX DFW), so if only the vCenter collector ran, the DFW rules have no nodes to match — they appear in `coverage.rules_without_targets`, not as passes. Third, individual hosts missing a value show up in `coverage.undetermined_node_checks`; that one is usually privilege or reachability, not a missing collector. Run a scan with all collectors installed, or pick a baseline whose `applies_to` matches what you have.

### Web dashboard shows 0 violations even after a scan
Verify the dashboard is reading the same DuckDB. If `VMWARE_HARDEN_DB` is set in your shell but not in the systemd/launchd unit running `vmware-harden web`, the web server reads the default `~/.vmware-harden/twin.duckdb` while your scans wrote elsewhere.

## Audit & Safety

1. **Source code**: [github.com/vmware-skills/VMware-Harden](https://github.com/vmware-skills/VMware-Harden) — MIT license, publicly auditable.
2. **Config / state files**: custom baselines in `~/.vmware-harden/baselines/*.yaml`; Twin DuckDB at `~/.vmware-harden/twin.duckdb`. No passwords are stored — all credentials live in the upstream skill (`~/.vmware-aiops/.env`).
3. **Webhook data scope**: none. Harden makes **no outbound network calls** other than (a) optional Anthropic API requests when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set for advisor suggestions, and (b) the local web dashboard bound to `127.0.0.1` by default.
4. **TLS verification**: harden does not connect to vCenter/NSX directly — TLS handling is delegated to vmware-aiops. The advisor's HTTPS calls to `api.anthropic.com` use system TLS verification (no opt-out).
5. **Prompt injection protection**: advisor LLM context is built exclusively from typed Twin queries (rule id, severity, evidence dict) — no free-text user input is forwarded. Evidence text passes through `_sanitize()` (truncate ≤500 chars, strip C0/C1 control characters).
6. **Least privilege**: all 8 MCP tools are read-only. Remediation execution is intentionally not exposed — agents that need to apply a fix must invoke **vmware-pilot**, which provides approval gates and audit logging.

All MCP operations are audited via the `@vmware_tool` decorator (vmware-policy dependency) to `~/.vmware/audit.db`. View with `vmware-audit log --last 20`.

**Environment scoping**: policy rules apply per environment, and skills that connect to a VMware estate declare `environment:` per target in their `config.yaml`. Harden has no such config — it reads through vmware-aiops and writes only its local Twin DB — so it reports a constant `local`. `scan_target` is its only state-changing tool, and the state it changes is the snapshot in that local DB; its vCenter interaction is read-only collection. No harden tool mutates a remote VMware estate, so there is no production change for an environment-scoped rule to protect.
